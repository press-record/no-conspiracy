# no-conspiracy
Live debates between people from different beliefs and cultures, and conspiracy theorists.
The objective is to point out obvious clues in our society that will lead people to believe not that a specific conspiracy is true, but that there is a conspiracy even
if we can not prove what that conspiracy may be.
The only goal is to prove that there is a conspiracy. (If there is one.)
I am looking for obvious evidence.
